Inspired by Andrej karpathy's [blog](https://karpathy.github.io/) and Francois Chollet's [ARC-AGI blog](https://arcprize.org/), I've decided to create my own.
Not because I presume to produce work as profound as theirs, but because their resources helped me dive into crucial concepts and discover the open problems in current research, which I likely would never have grasped otherwise.

Their blogs are a major reason why I’m now deeply involved in AI research. Like them, I wish to explain ideas in a clear and concise way that’s accessible to a broader audience. Hoping to be a droplet of water helping to nourish the open research community.
