Inspired by Andrej Karpathy’s blog and François Chollet’s ARC-AGI series, I’ve decided to start my own. Not because I presume to produce work as profound as theirs, but because their insights helped me grasp core concepts and limitations of AI that I might have otherwise missed.

Their writing played a major role in drawing me into AI research. I hope in a similar fashion to explain ideas clearly and concisely, in a way that’s accessible to a broader audience.

*May this lone droplet find its mark,*
*On unwithering gardens wide,*  
*Kindling forth the scarlet spark,*  
*In minds drawn by knowledge’s tide.*
