# My blog

Inspired by Andrej karpathy's [blog](https://karpathy.github.io/) and Francois Chollet's [ARC-AGI blog](https://arcprize.org/), I've decided to create my own.
Not because I presume to produce work as profound as theirs, but because their resources helped me dive into crucial concepts and limitations of AI that I might never have grasped otherwise.

Their blogs are a major reason why Iâ€™m now deeply involved in AI research. Like them, I hope to explain in a clear and concise way, that is accessible to a broader audience. Which I hope will give back to the community a fraction of what I received from it.
